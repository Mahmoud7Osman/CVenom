</ul>
<h4>Right Now I Am Making The Networking And Remote Data Transfer API, After That, The Kit's Core will be ready to develop malwares.</h4>
<p>C/C++ Are Absolutely The Best Languages To Develop Malwares, Advanced, And Undetectable, Hardware I/O Access, As You Know, C/C++ Codes, API Calls, Library Calls, System Calls Differ Between Linux And Windows, So, <strong>That's Why We Created CVenom</strong></p>

<h3>Cross-Platform OOP Based Malware Development</h3>
Malware Development Made Easy With CVenom, All Resources Are Objects, You Access The Hard Disk By Using The DiskTools Class, `Disk.FileCorrupt("file.txt")` as an Example will corrupt the file.txt And So On...Read The <a href="#documentation">Documentation</a> To Learn How To Start Developing Malwares With CVenom Or Watch Short Videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDoctorMLT">Right There</a>.

<h1>Making Malwares Without CVenom</h1>

<p>As You See The Difference Is Big, Using CVenom You Write Lesser Code, Cross-Platform, Super Simple And Readable Code, With It's Own Compiler That Compile Your Malware To An Obfuscated And Stripped Binary!, But, Without Using CVenom, You're Forced To Learn The Full System API With Syscalls, For Windows And Linux, Because Every OS Has it's Own System API And Syscalls, Then You're Gonna Write A 300 Lines Of Complicated Code To Make A Simple Malware (Maybe It is Gonna Be Buggy Haha)</p>
<h3>That's Why CVenom Exists!</h3>
